# Dr. [Your Name]
## Senior R&D Engineer | Quantum Information & High-Precision Timing

Welcome to my professional R&D portfolio. I am an Electronics Engineer specializing in the intersection of **theoretical physics** and **industrial hardware**. Currently, I am driving innovation at **Rakon**, focusing on the next generation of frequency control for AI, Cloud Computing, and Aerospace.

### 🚀 Strategic R&D Focus (2026 Roadmap)
As the industry moves toward nanosecond-level precision, my work ensures that timing solutions remain the "heartbeat" of global infrastructure.

* **AI & Data Centre Synchronization:** Developing ultra-stable OCXO and IC-based timing for Tier-1 AI infrastructure, focusing on sub-microsecond latency and high-speed data throughput.
* **Aerospace & Defence:** Leveraging high-precision frequency control to meet the rigorous demands of LEO satellite constellations and mission-critical positioning.
* **Quantum-Ready Timing:** Bridging the gap between classical oscillators and the timing requirements for **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** and 6G networks.

### 🔬 Technical Depth & Research
My R&D approach is grounded in advanced mathematical frameworks that provide a competitive edge in product development.

#### **Geometric Algebra ($Cl_{3,0}$) in Electromagnetics**
I utilize the Spacetime Algebra (STA) framework to simplify the modeling of electromagnetic fields in high-frequency resonators. By expressing Maxwell's Equations in a single multivector form, we achieve more efficient simulations:

$$\left( \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \nabla \right) (\mathbf{E} + I c \mathbf{B}) = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} - c \mu_0 \mathbf{J}$$

#### **Quantum Computation**
* **Expertise:** Analysis of Pauli gate logic and quantum information theory.
* **Application:** Advising on the future roadmap for high-stability references required for quantum-entangled communication systems.
