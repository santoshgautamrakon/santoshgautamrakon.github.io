# Industrial Projects & Technical Leadership
## Dr. [Your Name] | R&D at Rakon

This section details my contributions to Rakon’s core product lines and my role in aligning our technology with the 2026-2028 Strategic Roadmap.

### 1. AI & Cloud Infrastructure: MercuryX™ Series
I have played a key role in the R&D and validation of the **MercuryX™** and **Mercury+™** IC-OCXO product families. These products are the "heartbeat" of Tier-1 AI data centres.

* **Objective:** Achieving nanosecond-level synchronisation for high-speed AI workloads.
* **Key Contribution:** Applied advanced signal integrity analysis to ensure the **ROM1490X** achieves its industry-leading **8-hour holdover** and ±1.5 ppb frequency stability.
* **Impact:** Positioned Rakon as a top-tier supplier for AI hardware clusters, contributing to the 50% YoY revenue growth in the AI/Cloud segment.

### 2. NewSpace & Satellite Constellations: RK409 Series
My work supports the "NewSpace" revolution, providing radiation-resilient timing for LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite constellations.

* **Project:** Ultra-Stable Space OCXO (RK409RBNS).
* **Technical Challenge:** Maintaining sub-ppb stability in vacuum and extreme temperature environments while minimizing Power, Size, and Weight (SWaP).
* **Result:** Developed testing protocols that validated these units as compact alternatives to miniature atomic clocks, securing Rakon’s position in a $75m+ Aerospace & Defence order book.

### 3. Telecommunications: 6G & URLLC Networks
I contribute to the development of next-generation timing for **Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC)**.

* **Focus:** Next-generation ASICs (including the **Vulcan™** and **Niku™** platforms).
* **Methodology:** Integrated my PhD-level research in **Geometric Algebra** to streamline electromagnetic modelling of resonators, reducing the design-to-prototype cycle for high-frequency 5G/6G radio heads.

### 🛡️ Strategic Value for the Bourns Acquisition
The acquisition by **Bourns Inc.** represents a significant opportunity for global scaling. My expertise provides three specific values to the combined entity:

1.  **IP Stewardship:** Deep understanding of Rakon’s proprietary ASIC and XMEMS® technology.
2.  **Market Diversification:** Proven experience in the AI/Data Centre vertical—a primary growth area for Bourns’ industrial sensors.
3.  **Future-Proofing:** My research in **Quantum Information** ensures that our timing modules will meet the future requirements of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and encrypted satellite links.
