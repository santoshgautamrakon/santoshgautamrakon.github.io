# Research & Advanced Analytical Frameworks
## Dr. [Your Name] | Applied Physics & Quantum Information

This page provides an overview of my academic research and its application to high-precision engineering. My work focuses on using advanced mathematical structures to optimize the design and performance of frequency control systems.

### 1. Geometric Algebra (GA) in Engineering
During my doctoral research, I focused on the application of **Clifford (Geometric) Algebra** as a unified language for physics and engineering. In my current R&D role, I translate these insights into hardware optimization.

#### **Advanced Electromagnetics ($Cl_{3,0}$)**
Traditional vector calculus often obscures the underlying geometry of electromagnetic interactions. By using the **Spacetime Algebra (STA)** framework, I can represent Maxwell’s Equations in a compact, coordinate-independent multivector form:

$$\nabla F = J$$

* **Application to Frequency Control:** Utilizing bivector formulations to model 3D electromagnetic field distributions in high-Q resonators. This reduces simulation errors and improves the accuracy of phase-noise predictions in OCXO designs.
* **Vector Optimization:** Replacing traditional matrix-based rotations with **Rotors**, which are numerically more stable and computationally efficient for modeling the orientation-dependent frequency shifts in crystal oscillators.

### 2. Quantum Computation & Information
My research at the **University of Auckland** and **Sheffield Hallam** involved the mathematical architecture of quantum systems, specifically focusing on gate operations and error mitigation.

#### **Pauli Gate Logic & Quantum Timing**
The transition to **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** and quantum networking requires timing references with unprecedented stability.

* **Pauli Operators:** Expertise in the $X, Y, Z$ Pauli matrices and their representation within the $Cl_{3,0}$ algebra. I explore how the geometric interpretation of these gates can lead to more robust quantum circuit designs.
* **Quantum-Secure Synchronization:** Developing the roadmap for timing modules that support the ultra-low jitter requirements of single-photon detectors used in quantum communication.
